# PCA-clinical-appointment-no-show


# Description:
### It is essential for businesses to understand which features of the dataset has the highest impact on the desired outcome. Having the knowledge can help organizations in resouce allocation strategy effectively and efficiently to ensure the intervention to improve desired outcome. In this interesting project, the dataset used is about patients who did not show up to their appointments. Finding ways to encourage patients to show up to their appointment to get appropriate treatment is always a priority, especially in the ambulatory healthcare setting. Ultimately, this can benefit healthcare facilities to maximize their scheduling efforts and craft strategies to encourage patients to show up to appointments.Â¶


#  Project Objective:
### To find out 3 components have the most impact on the desired outcome. The features that can explain the most variance is identified so healthcare facilities can gain actionable insights and craft appropriate startegies and plans.


# Process:
### This interesting project will start off with exploratory data analysis, data cleansing, feature-engineering, and preprocessing the data. Then, The Principle Component Analysis from sklearn library will be used and fit to the data. This model offers to explain, in a 2-D graphical form, the variance from the most significant 3 components in all features. Finally, the most relevant features from the vast dataset will be shown in the graphical form.
